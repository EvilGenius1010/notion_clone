This is a Caderno, a new note taking experience. This aims to provide a simple note taking experience along with features like offline availability.
However, this project is currently a work in progress.
## Getting Started

First, clone this repository using
```
git clone https://github.com/EvilGenius1010/notion_clone.git
```
Note that this repository uses `pnpm` as its package manager.

Then,install dependencies using 
```pnpm install ```

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

I would greatly appreciate a star if you liked the project and follow me on Github as well.
